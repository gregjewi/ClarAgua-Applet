# Deployments

Here's where the rubber meets the road.
The business end of the applet where we get to visualize and inspect the most recent data from site installations.
Woot.

For now, each deployment gets its own subdirectory within ``deployments/``.
**Importantly the name of the folder matches exactly that of the site id.**
So if you're going to make deploy a new chlorinator to feed into the app, you need to be conscious of the name you give the chlorinator.

After naming correctly the subdirectory, copy and past the `index.php` file from an existing subdirectory into the new one.

Voila.
